As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation, and information to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software. The history of computer science began long before our modern discipline of computer science, starting with the abacus in 2500 BC. With the invention of the analytical engine in the 19th century by Charles Babbage, and later the development of the electronic computer, computer science has come a long way. Some important milestones include the invention of the transistor in 1947, the development of the integrated circuit in 1958, and the creation of high-level programming languages, such as Python, in the late 20th century.'"}
