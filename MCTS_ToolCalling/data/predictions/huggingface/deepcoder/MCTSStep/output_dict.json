Climate change has resulted in rising temperatures and fluctuating weather patterns, leading to devastating natural disasters such as floods, heatwaves, and droughts. To mitigate the impacts of climate change, it is essential to adopt measures like reducing greenhouse gas emissions, shifting to renewable energy sources, and conserving forests and other natural resources.'
